Indexing the articles in Sleeping For Less - https://www.akexorcist.com

What's it about?
===========================
Because I'm too lazy to buitl the index page (https://www.akexorcist.com/2013/02/android-article-index.html) for entire articles in Sleeping For Less (https://www.akexorcist.com). So I created this project to request all articles from the Blogger API into JSON then build it to HTML to replaces in index page. That's all!!
